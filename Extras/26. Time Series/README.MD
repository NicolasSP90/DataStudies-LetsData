# Time Series
A time series refers to a sequence of data points collected, observed, or recorded at successive and equally spaced points in time. 
Time series data is used to analyze trends, patterns, and behaviors over time. 
Analyzing time series data involves techniques such as trend analysis, seasonality detection, and forecasting to extract meaningful insights and make predictions about future values based on past observations.
