# Feature Importance
 Studying the concept of Feature Importance and applying it to an exemple. Some things to consider:
 - The model used to evaluate Feature Importance MUST NOT be used for anything else;
 - Careful to not create bias on the final model (the one that will go to production) based on the model used to calculate Feature Importance;
 - Use several methods to analyse Feature Importance in a way that the decision will not rely on only one method. This way the process of decision-making will be more accurate and robust.
